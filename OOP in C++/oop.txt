why we need object oriented programming?
    =>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is needed for organizing and structuring complex software systems, promoting code reusability, modularity, encapsulation, polymorphism, and maintainability.

class is a fundamental unit of OOP.It is userdefined data type.
objects are variable of type class.

Constructor used to initialize an object with some values.This is function which is called when the object is created.Same name as class name.

Destructor is a function which is called when the object is destroyed/deleted.In this function we can't pass any parameters.We can write destructor in that way:
        ~(class name)


Encapsulation is a property of oops which insure binding of methods and variables together into a single unit.(unit-class) .It also leads to abstraction/hiding.

Abstraction is a property of oops which enable us to display only essential information while hiding implementation details.

Inheritance is a process of creating new class called derived class from existing class called base class.
